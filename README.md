Key Takeaways

 

The key to a successful school and an unsuccessful school is math performance. Districtwide, success is determined by a passing percentage (>70%) of students in both math and reading. Independently, the district has a high percentage of students passing reading, 82.97%, but the percentage of students passing math is borderline, 72.39%. Which leads to the overall passing student’s percentage of 65.17%. There are students that are strong readers but not strong mathematicians. That’s the key to improving district performance.
The top performing schools in the district are all charter schools. These schools are Cabrera, Thomas, Griffin, Wilson, & Pena. The lowest performing schools are all district schools, these are: Johnson, Hernandez, Huang, Figueroa, and Rodriguez. While the top schools have an overall passing % of students in the low 90s, the bottom performing schools have an overall passing % in the low 50s. The low performing schools have average reading success, but below average passing math percentages.
The spending level per student is not determinative of school performance. The top five performing schools, all charters, have spending levels that range from low to high. The best performing school has a spending level that is low compared to the rest of the district. The poorest performing schools all have high spending compared to the rest of the district.
School size appears to be a key factor in school performance. There are 15 high schools in the district. The top 8 schools are all either small or below the mean in size. The bottom 7 schools are all above the mean or larger in size. There is a similar division by charter and district schools. Which leads to a broad conclusion, the smaller charter schools outperform the larger district schools more efficiently because they use less spending per student. Whether it is more selective enrollment or higher parental engagement, the charter schools are the primary reason the district is performing as well as it is.
